== Description ==
With this lightweight plugin you can add a simple tag in your main content or menus that will be replaced with the users username, email, first name, last name, display name or account ID when logged in. If the user is not logged in the nothing is returned.

The tags are not shortcodes and therefore you can easily use them within your standard content, page builders, HTML tags like h1 etc, widgets or within menu item navigation labels and titles.
